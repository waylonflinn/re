# Re

Do it again, if it doesn't work the first time. Supports various configurable
retry strategies, including: constant, exponential backoff and linear backoff.

Functions are styled to match the simplicity and ease of use found in the [async](https://github.com/caolan/async)
 library.

## Install

```
npm install re
```


## Quick Example

```javascript
var Re = require('re'),
    re = new Re();

re.try(repeatMe, doMeAtTheEnd);

var repeatMe = function(retryCount, done){
    if(retryCount < 2) done(new Error("Not there yet!"));
    else done(null, retryCount);
};

var doMeAtTheEnd = function(err, retryCount){
    console.log("It took this many tries: " + retryCount);
};
```

## In the Browser
Tested in recent versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. Usage:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="re.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var re = new Re();

  re.try(repeatMe, doMeAtTheEnd);
      
  // repeatMe and doMeAtTheEnd are exactly as above

</script>
```

Try it in your browser with this test: [test/test.html](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/waylonflinn/re/blob/master/test/test.html) or play with the test in this fiddle: [re-fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/7C26s/1/embedded/result/) (these pages don't work in IE, because it's recently gone from lax to pedantic).

## Usage

If you like the defaults, call it like this:

```javascript
var Re = require('re'),
    re = new Re();

re.try(function(retryCount, done){
    if(retryCount < 2) done(new Error("Not there yet!"));
    else done(null, retryCount);
  },
  function(err, retryCount){
    console.log("It took this many retries: " + retryCount);
});
```


The `re.try` function takes two arguments, a function to call until it works
(or we run out of retries) and a function to call when it finally succeeds (or
we fail too many times).
As the name suggests we automatically wrap your function in a standard `try`
block and, if an exception occurs, call it again according to the retry schedule.

This first function passed to `re.try` should take 2 arguments like this:

```javascript
function operation(retryCount, done)
```

The `retryCount` argument is the number of the current retry. It'll be zero the first time 
and get bigger every time.

The `done` argument is a function to call when you've completed your operation.
If you encounter an error condition, pass in the `err` object
as the first argument. If you don't encounter an error, pass in a falsy first
argument (null works). If you give us a falsy error and no exception happens,
we call your callback with all the arguments passed into this function.

The second function passed to `re.try` can take as many arguments as you like but
should always start with an error parameter. This will be falsy, if no error happens.

The `re.do` function is like `re.try` except it doesn't wrap your operation in
a `try...catch`.

## Options

The default options look like this:

```javascript
var options = {
    retries : 10,
    strategy : {
      "type": Re.STRATEGIES.EXPONENTIAL,
      "initial":100,
      "base":2
    }
}
```

You pass this options object into the `Re` constructor.

```javascript
var Re = require('re'),
    re = new Re(options);
```

This gives you 10 retries and an exponential backoff strategy with the following progression (in milliseconds): 100, 200,
400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 12800, 25600, 51200

### Retry Strategy Examples

The following will retry every 400 milliseconds:

```javascript
{"type": Re.STRATEGIES.CONSTANT, "initial": 400}
```

The following will give a linear backoff strategy that has the following progression (when paired with `retries: 10`) : 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 1800

```javascript
{"type": Re.STRATEGIES.LINEAR, "initial": 200, "max":1800}
```

Both progressive strategies accept the `max` option.  All strategies also accept a
`rand` option. This is a `Boolean` that adds a random multiplier between 1 and 2.
This makes them act like the tradition backoff function. This option is set to `false` by default.

## Stability

Test coverage is good and expanding. We use [mocha](http://mochajs.org/). 

## Technical Details

The traditional exponential backoff function is described here:
[Exponential Backoff in Distributed Systems](http://dthain.blogspot.com/2009/02/exponential-backoff-in-distributed.html).
This is equivalent to our exponential backoff function with the `rand` option set to `true`.

Our formula for exponential backoff looks something like this, when using all the options:

```javascript
return Math.min(random * initial * Math.pow(base, retry), max);
```

Where `random` is a random number in the half-open interval [1, 2). When randomness is turned off,
the value of this variable is always 1.

If you don't specify the `max` option, the formula looks like this:

```javascript
return random * initial * Math.pow(base, retry);
```


I'm shamelessly stealing the following link from [node-retry](https://github.com/tim-kos/node-retry)
just because it's fun for nerdy math people to play with.
You can use it to calculate the exact value you need for the `base` option so that all
retry intervals sum to a desired amount: [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sum%5B100*x%5Ek%2C+%7Bk%2C+0%2C+9%7D%5D+%3D+30+*+1000).
